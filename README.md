Planned future replacement to [u8-emu-frontend](https://github.com/gamingwithevets/u8-emu-frontend) written in Python.
This new, fresh emulator built fully from scratch and written in C++ will be faster than the previous Python-C hybrid version.

Currently, configuration files aren't yet implemented. A default configuration is used.
